* Time series data

ARIMA. Holt-Winters and EMWA. Regression with time series errors. Bayesian hierarchical temporal models. Bayesian model averaging. Support vector regression. Splines. “Chaotic” nonlinear time series methods. I could go on.

Each of these has the potential to do better in specific cases than RNNs - and are often faster to train.
